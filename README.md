# Quora Question Pair Similarity
Scope of this project is to classify question pairs as duplicate or non-duplicate by using NLP
techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction and then applying classification algorithms on
the extracted features. 

Then the algorithm which gives the best performance metrics will be chosen.


Various classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM (Support Vector Machine), Random
Forest, and XGBoost will be used.
